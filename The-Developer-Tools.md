The developer tools are the tools built in to Firefox to help developers build and debug web apps. Access the tools from the `Web Developer` menu (OS X: `Tools` > `Web Developer`), or using the keyboard shortcuts:

Toggling one of these menu items will open the devtools window with that tool selected. Or just select `Toggle Tools` to open the window. The devtools window contains all of the developer tools in one place:

## Get the latest tools

Use the [Aurora](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/) or [Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/) (bleeding-edge) channels of Firefox to get the latest and greatest devtools as soon as they're added.
